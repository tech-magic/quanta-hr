## 🌟 Key Benefits

- **Private & Secure**  
  Keep all your HR data on-premise or in your private cloud. Your sensitive information never leaves your infrastructure.  

- **Custom-Tailored Knowledge**  
  Build your own QLoRA LLM on your company-specific HR policies, documents, and FAQs. QuantaHR understands your organization like no generic model can.  

- **Resource-Efficient**  
  Unlike massive general-purpose LLMs that require high CPU, memory, and storage, QuantaHR is **optimized for minimal resources** — making it feasible to run on standard servers or even powerful desktop machines.  

- **Fast & Responsive**  
  Smaller model size + optimized quantization means faster inference times and near-instant responses for your HR queries.  

- **Easy to Deploy & Scale**  
  Deploy QuantaHR on your local machine, private server, or containerized environment. Scale according to your team’s needs without breaking the bank.

## 📈 Why QuantaHR?

Running large general-purpose LLMs is **expensive and resource-heavy**. QuantaHR leverages **QLoRA quantization** to deliver:  

- Drastically reduced memory footprint  
- Faster CPU inference  
- Lower storage requirements  
- A model trained **specifically for your HR domain**  

All this without compromising on accuracy or intelligence.
